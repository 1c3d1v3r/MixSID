There is only a single address control line called MODE SELECT (MS).

Parallel Addressing Mode

If MODE SELECT is HIGH, SID2 will be addressed in parallel with SID1
each 32 bytes in $D400-D800 (as usual).

In addition, SID2 will *only* be selected if RW is low, so the second
sid will always be write-only when it appears in parallel with
SID1. This way read accesses (for paddles and music effects) will only
ever read from SID1.

Orthogonal Addressing Mode

If MODE SELECT is LOW, SID1 and SID2 will be addressed as shown in the
table below.

The defacto standard for stereo SID tunes is to address the second
sid either at $D420 or at $D500. In this scheme, the SID2 will always
appear at both of these addresses (among others), and SID1 is
garanteed *not* to appear at any of the addresses that SID2 appears
at. In addition, SID2 will be read-write.

If the user wants the second SID to also appear in the IO areas DE00
and/or DF00 in this addressing mode, all that is required is to
connect the corresponding signals (IO1 and IO2) in addition to A5 and
A8. This will allow the board to be used with systems like
prophet/mssiah, which expect the SID at these addresses.

Rationale

This solution removes the need for multiple jumper configurations to
select the adress of SID2. Instead of using one jumper setting for
each of the possible/desired addresses for SID2, only a single control
line can be used. A simple SPST switch may be used to pull MS low. If
the switch is open, the internal input pullup of the GAL will drive it
high.

Another advantage over a jumper solution is that the CS signals are
guaranteed to be connected and there is no chance of the CS pins to
float. (If the SID CS line is floating, it will be asserted randomly
and the SID will feel compelled to put data on the bus at any time,
causing almost certain lock ups on a running machine).
