The smartsid board will feature on board op-amp based output circuits
for both sids as well as an audio mixer that controls which signals
finally end up at the stereo output pins.

Two control signals (M0 and M1) will be provided that control the
different mixing options:

 M0 | M1 | Left | Right
----|----|------|------|
 0  | 0  | SID1 | SID1 | (first SID mono)
 0  | 1  | SID2 | SID2 | (second SID mono)
 1  | 0  | SID1 | SID2 | (first SID left, second SID right)
 1  | 1  | SID2 | SID1 | (first SID right, second SID left)
