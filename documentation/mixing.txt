The MixSID board features on-board output circuits for both sids
as well as an audio mixer that controls which signals finally end up
at the stereo output pins.

Two control signals (M0 and M1) are provided that control the
different mixing options:

 M0 | M1 | Left | Right
----|----|------|------|
 0  | 0  | SID2 | SID2 | (left SID on both channels)
 0  | 1  | SID1 | SID1 | (right SID on both channels)
 1  | 0  | SID1 | SID2 | (right SID left, left SID right)
 1  | 1  | SID2 | SID1 | (left SID left, right SID right)

The last setting is the default setting if the M0 and M1 lines are not
actively driven.

At build time the user may also choose which SID is to be routed to
the existing output circuit on the C64 board and will thus end up at
the monitor or TV mono output. Either one of the two sids may be used
exclusively, or both signals may be mixed down to mono using
appropriate resitors. Note that mixing both outputs here will cause
some crosstalk between the SIDs, i.e. the sound of one SID will always
be slightly audible in the output of the other, and vice versa. Thus
if you need to have the pure sound of each SID you should not mix them
down to mono in this way.
